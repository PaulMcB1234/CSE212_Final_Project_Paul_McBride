# Trees


## Root to Branches
Trees are exactly as they sound, they start with what is called a root, and branch off into leafs. The "Root" refers to the first item in the tree (Level 1 in the picture below). The leaves are the ends of the tree (level 3 and 4 in the picture below). When addressing a particular node in the tree, we call the node that precedes it the "Parent" node. Which means that the node in question is called the "Child" node.
